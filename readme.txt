Complex/ion is a game engine designed for use with multiplayer tilebased 2D games.

It is currently incomplete and many vital features are missing. Current features include:
- Representation of objects, their location on maps, and their appearance
- Player login, viewport, and client-server synchronization
- Incomplete integration with the TWL GUI toolkit, including the ability to create widgets from the server
